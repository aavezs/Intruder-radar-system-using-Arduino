# Intruder-radar-system-using-Arduino
An intruder radar system using Arduino is a project that utilizes an Arduino board along with an ultrasonic sensor to detect any intruders entering a certain area. The system works by sending out ultrasonic waves that bounce off any object in their path, and then measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back.
